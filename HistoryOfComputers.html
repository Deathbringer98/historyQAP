	<h2>In The Beginning ...</h2>

	<p>The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the birth of the abacus. When the beads<br> 
        on the abacus are moved around, according to programming rules memorized by the user, all regular<br> 
        arithmetic problems can be done. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was<br> 
        built in 1694. It could add, and, after changing some things around, multiply. About a century later<br> 
        Thomas of Colmar created the first successful mechanical calculator that could add, subtract, multiply,<br> 
        and divide.</p>

  <h2>Other Memorable Events...</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In 1812, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really a series of predictable actions<br> 
            that were constantly repeated. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine,<br> 
            which he called a difference engine.</li>
        <br>
		<li>Herman Hollerith and James Powers made a step towards automated computing with the<br>
             development of<a href="https://ethw.org/Early_Punched_Card_Equipment,_1880_-_1951"target="_blank"> punched cards</a>. Reading errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased,<br> 
             and stacks of punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size. For more than 50<br>
              years, punched card machines did most of the world's first business computing.</li>
        <br>
		<li>The start of World War II produced a large need for computer capacity. In 1942, John P. Eckert<br>
             and John W. Mauchly decided to build a high-speed electronic computer to do the job. Known<br>
              as ENIAC, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.</li>
		<br>
        <li>Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer field<br>
             - Magnetic Core Memory and Transistor-Circuit Elements. These technical discoveries quickly<br>
              found their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found in large computer centers<br>
               operated by industry, government, and private laboratories.</li>

        <li>In the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest possible computer with the greatest<br>
             capacity reached a turning point with the<br>
              Stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest access time,
               and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words.</li>
		<br>
        <li>Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced programmable minicomputers<br> 
            supplied with software packages in the 1970’s. The "shrinking" trend continued with the<br> 
            introduction of personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small enough and<br> 
            inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals. Many companies, such as Apple<br> 
            Computer and Radio Shack introduced very successful PCs in the 1970’s.</li>
		<br>
        <li>By the late 1980’s, some personal computers were run by microprocessors that, handling 32 bits<br> 
            of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.</li>
		<br>
        <li>Computer networking, e-mail and the Internet, and electronic publishing are just a few of the<br> 
            applications that have grown in recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price, offering<br> 
            the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes, offices, and schools”.</li>

<h2>HTML Features...</h2>


  <ul>
    <li> '< img >'' tag: The '< img >'' tag is used to embed an image into an HTML document.<br> 
        It has attributes such as src, alt, width, and height. The src attribute specifies the URL of the image to be displayed.<br>
         The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be<br>
         loaded or if the user is using a screen reader. The width and height attributes specify the size of the image in pixels.</li>
         <br>
    <li> < a > tag: The '< a >' tag is used to create a hyperlink to another web page,<br> 
        file, or location on the same page. It has an href attribute that specifies the URL of the page or<br> 
        file to link to. The text between the opening and closing '< a >'<br>
        tags is the visible link text that the user clicks on.</li>
<br>
    <li> < div > tag: The < div > tag is used to create a container for HTML elements and to apply CSS styles<br>
         to groups of elements. It does not have any inherent meaning or functionality, but is used to structure<br>
          and style the content of a web page. It can be used to group related content, to create columns, to define<br>
           a section of a page, or to apply styles to a block of content.</li>

<h3><b>Explanation...</b></h3>

<p>In the new section, we have added a heading < h2 >Some information about HTML< /h2>. Below the heading,<br>
    there is an unordered list `< ul >` with three list items `< li >`. The list is centered using the `< center >`<br> 
    tag. We have also added a paragraph with centered text using the `text-align: center;` CSS style. Additionally, we included<br>
     an example of bold centered text using the `< strong >` tag and the `text-align: center;` style.</p>

  <h2>CSS Feature...</h2>
  <p>For your convenience, CSS includes a variety of built-in <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/8-cool-css-tips-tricks-to-impress/"target="_blank">cursor</a> kinds. 
    Depending on the present state of the website interface, they support a variety of circumstances.
     For instance, when items are loading, you could need a loading state pointer. 

    The users are informed that something is happening in the background and that they should wait until the fetching is complete.</p>
